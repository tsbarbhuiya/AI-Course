# 🎮 Maze Solver – Visual BFS Algorithm

A browser-based interactive maze solver where you create walls and set start/end points, then watch the **Breadth-First Search (BFS)** algorithm find the shortest path in the maze.

## 🧠 Algorithm Used

This game uses the **Breadth-First Search (BFS)** algorithm, a graph traversal method that explores neighbors level by level. It guarantees the shortest path in unweighted grids like mazes by checking all possible paths systematically.

## 🛠️ Requirements

- Any modern web browser (Chrome, Firefox, Edge, etc.)  
- No additional frameworks or libraries needed

## 🎮 How to Play

1. Left-click on cells to toggle walls (black cells).  
2. Right-click on a cell to set the **Start** point (green).  
3. Hold **Shift + Left-click** on a cell to set the **End** point (red).  
4. Click **Solve Maze** to watch BFS find the shortest path (highlighted in yellow).  
5. Click **Restart** to clear the maze and start fresh.
