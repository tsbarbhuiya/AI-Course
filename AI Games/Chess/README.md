# Chess Game (Human vs AI)

## üìò Overview

This project implements a **Chess game** where a human player plays as White against an AI opponent (Black). The AI uses the **Minimax algorithm** for decision-making, with an evaluation based on **material count**. The game includes a GUI built with **Tkinter**.

## ‚öôÔ∏è How to Run

1. Ensure **Python 3.x** is installed on your system.
2. Install the required libraries:

## üéÆ How to Play

1. Click on a White piece to select it.
2. Click on a valid destination square to move the piece.
3. The AI will make its move automatically after yours.

5. You can use the buttons to:

   * **Restart**: Reset the game.
   * **Pause/Resume**: Pause or resume the game.
   * **Level**: Change AI difficulty (Easy/Medium/Hard).

### Features

* Check/checkmate signal with blinking effect.
* Pawn promotion dialog.
* AI difficulty levels adjusting the depth of Minimax.

## üß∞ Algorithm Used

* **Minimax Algorithm**: AI evaluates all possible moves up to a depth limit and chooses the move with the optimal outcome.
* **Heuristic Evaluation**: Counts material value (pieces) to determine the board score.

| Piece  | Value | 
| ------ | ----- | 
| Pawn   | 1     |  
| Knight | 3     | 
| Bishop | 3     | 
| Rook   | 5     | 
| Queen  | 9     | 
| King   | 1000  | # High to prioritize safety |
