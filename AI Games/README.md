# AI Games Collection

This project contains three classic games, each powered by intelligent AI algorithms:

- **Tic Tac Toe (AI Opponent)**
- **Chess (AI Opponent)**
- **Maze Solver (AI Pathfinding)**

## Overview

### Tic Tac Toe
- Classic 3x3 grid game.
- AI opponent uses the Minimax algorithm for optimal play.
- Single-player mode where you challenge the AI.

### Chess
- Fully functional chess game.
- AI opponent powered by Minimax with alpha-beta pruning.
- Enforces standard chess rules and move validation.

### Maze Solver
- Automatically solves mazes using AI search algorithms.
- Implements BFS, DFS, and A* to find the shortest path.
- Visualizes maze and solution path.
