# üåü AI Algorithm Implementation

## üìò Overview

This directory contains professional implementations of key **Artificial Intelligence algorithms** in Python. Each sub-folder is structured to include the Python source code, input/output examples as screenshots, and a dedicated README file with detailed explanations.

These projects are intended for educational purposes, providing clear and well-documented examples of different AI techniques for learning and experimentation.

## üß© Sub-Folders and Algorithms

1. **A*_Search**
   Implementation of the **A* Search Algorithm** for optimal pathfinding using heuristic-based evaluation.

2. **Alpha_Beta**
   Demonstrates **Alpha-Beta Pruning**, an optimization of the Minimax algorithm for efficient decision-making in games.

3. **Beam_Search**
   Implements **Beam Search**, a heuristic search algorithm with limited exploration width for large search spaces.

4. **Best_First_Search**
   Shows **Greedy Best First Search**, selecting nodes based solely on heuristic estimates towards the goal.

5. **Bidirectional_search**
   Implements **Bidirectional Search**, an efficient technique that searches simultaneously from the start and goal states.

6. **Breadth_First_Search**
   Demonstrates **Breadth-First Search (BFS)**, an uninformed search strategy exploring neighbors level by level.

7. **Depth_First_Search**
   Implements **Depth-First Search (DFS)**, exploring nodes along each branch as deep as possible.

8. **Depth_Limited_Search**
   Shows **Depth-Limited Search**, a DFS variant with a maximum depth to prevent infinite exploration.

9. **Iterative_Deepening_Search**
   Combines the benefits of BFS and DFS using **Iterative Deepening**, progressively deepening the search depth.

10. **Minimax_Algorithm**
    Implements the **Minimax Algorithm** for optimal decision-making in adversarial games.
